                My name is John Gu. I was born and raised in Beijing, China. I came to Canada 8 years ago and have lived in Barrie since then.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a father of two cats. Doodie is the first cat I adopted from Petsmart. He is the one I showcased above on the left! He loves people and is good hunter!
            </p>
            <p>
                Murnie is the second cat of mine, She is timid and afraid of people, you can only find her when hovering the cursor over Doodie. However she is very vocal around her human parents and her brother. And she likes to follow Doodie around and stay behind him!
            </p>
